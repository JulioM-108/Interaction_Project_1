## Project Description
This project is a creative intervention of the **Mortal Kombat** movie trailer, a film based on the 1 vs 1 fighting video game, known for its violent and bloody tone.  

The goal was to transform the original atmosphere of **action and death** into a **comedic experience** by using sound resources and editing techniques.

## Techniques Used
- **AI-generated voices**: voices from well-known characters such as:
  - The Gingerbread Man (Shrek)  
  - Deadpool  
  - Homer Simpson  
  - Among others  

- **Background music**: based on a **Super Smash Bros** soundtrack.  

- **Audio editing**:
  - Cutting and assembling sound clips.  
  - Adding effects and dialogues.  
  - Organizing volumes and adjusting frequencies to achieve consistency in the mix.  

## Outcome
- The final result is a reinterpreted trailer with a **humorous twist**, keeping the visual dynamics of the original material but with a sound design that completely changes the perception of the scene.  

- To achieve this effect, we used **AI-generated voices of well-known characters and cartoons**, which added an exaggerated and comedic tone to the dialogues.  
In addition, **sound effects were cut and inserted with humorous intent**, reinforcing the scenes and creating greater comic impact in key moments.  

- We did this with the purpose of analyzing **how audio can completely transform the viewer’s experience** through editing, mixing techniques, and creative resources such as artificial intelligence and sound effects.
